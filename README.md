Simulife can receive input from a model, as well as send information to the model (both sent as XML files) and draw the graphics based on the changes, making it possible to see the ongoing events of the entire model on the screen in real time. It is based on WebGL (Web Graphics Library), a JavaScript API (THREE.js framework in our case) for rendering interactive 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. The client side is Chrome and the communication with external engines is done via sockets.
